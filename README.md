# Project Euler Solutions
The files collected here implement solutions to the mathematical/programming puzzles listed at [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/).

These are typically throw-away scripts, which may not meet general coding conventions. But I found some of the solutions interesting, so I've recorded them here for reference.
